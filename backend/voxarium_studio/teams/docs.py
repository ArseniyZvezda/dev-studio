"""Project documentation as a team medium (§10.4).

Kanban tasks carry the *work*; documents carry the *decisions* — a game designer writes
the feature spec, the developer implements against it, the tester checks against it. The
files live in the managed project's ``.voxarium_studio/docs`` so they are diffable and reviewable
in git next to the pipelines and the team roster (§5).

Deliberately a plain directory of Markdown, not a table: a document is worth more when a
human can open it in their own editor, and the Explorer already knows how to show it.

Everything that has to know what is *in* the tree — link resolution, backlinks, search,
the graph — goes through one signature-validated index (:meth:`DocStore._index`) rather
than re-walking the directory. What made that necessary is recorded on
:meth:`DocStore.backlinks`.

A folder of the tree has a look of its own — a colour and an icon, kept in a
``vxs-folder.json`` inside it — and can be renamed, which mends every link the new name
would otherwise break (block-editor spec §5.2, :meth:`DocStore.rename_folder`), or deleted
with everything in it (:meth:`DocStore.delete_folder`).

        **A folder rename mends links, and a document rename does not** (:meth:`move`). The
        difference is what a link says. A document's name is the word its authors wrote, so
        renaming one and rewriting the prose that points at it would be the Studio editing other
        people's sentences. A folder is in a link only when the link spells out a path — which
        the ``[[`` menu writes just to tell two documents of one name apart — and swapping the
        start of such a path changes nothing anybody chose.

        What counts as broken is decided by resolution, never by searching for the old name:
        every link that resolved before the rename resolves to the *same document* after it. A
        path through the old folder is the common case. The rule also catches the rare one — a
        bare ``[[notes]]`` whose tie between two ``notes.md`` the new name reorders — and pins
        that link to the document it meant. A link that resolved to nothing is left alone.

        The folder goes first and the links after, on purpose. A directory rename is one call
        that happens or does not; rewriting the referrers first would, on a folder Windows
        refuses to rename, leave every link in the project pointing at a name that never came to
        exist. This order can at worst leave the one document whose file could not be written
        with its old link — and the frame for that document says so.

        Returns once the folder is renamed, with the mending running as a task of its own, so a
        client that stops listening does not stop it half-way through the referrers. Renames are
        serialised: a second one plans against a tree the first has finished mending.

    ``\\\\?\\`` prefix, and drops that prefix only if a *second* query verifies the stripped
    form. The prefix therefore survives whenever the name stops existing between those two

    gives 0 as well, which is what ``write`` below does, so the Studio's own saves are never
    the trigger. What does it is the name vanishing, even for microseconds: **renaming away
    and back, 11.7%**, and **delete-and-recreate, 5.8%**. That is a Plastic update or a
    branch switch rewriting the working copy — the case §9.6 already expects — and it is far
    too common to leave to chance.
